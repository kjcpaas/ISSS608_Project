# Motivation

The motivation for this project stems from the urgent need to combat illegal fishing activities in the sensitive marine ecosystem of Oceanus. FishEye International aims to protect this environment by monitoring and analyzing business activities of commercial fishing operators. This project seeks to enhance the ability of FishEye’s analysts to visualize and understand complex business networks, and further aiding in the detection and prevention of illegal fishing.

# Objectives

This project aims to build an interactive visualization tool to enable FishEye’s analysts to effectively interpret the following changes related to illegal fishing on the business community:

1.  **Temporal patterns and corporate structures**: Highlight temporal patterns and corporate structures changes for analysts to track shareholders over time.

2.  **Business Transactions**: Identify typical and atypical business transactions and infer the motivations behind these activities.

3.  **Network Influence**: Examine how the influence of a company changes over time within the business network.

4.  **SouthSeafood Express Corp Network**: Visualize the network associated with SouthSeafood Express Corp and analyze how the network have changed due to the illegal fishing incident. Identify companies that benefited from SouthSeafood Express Corp’s legal troubles and potentially related transactions.

# Data

The project will examine the data from VAST Challenge 2024 [Mini-Challenge 3](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2024/MC3.html). The data contains the network for Oceanus’s commercial fishing business community. It contains 60,520 nodes, 75,817 edges, and 4,782 connected components.

Each node represents the entities in the fishing business community (including people and organizations). The edges represent the relationship between each pair of connected nodes.

# Methodology

The team will take the following approach:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and shaping data to what is needed for analysis. The following data will be prepared:

    -   Node and edge data for network data analysis. \@We will only use the 4,782 connected components in plotting the network data
    -   Non-network data for accompanying information, if needed (e.g. how many people involved, information about companies involved in fishing business)

2.  **Data Exploration & Visualization:** To identify patterns in the data and derive insights from them. We will use the following visualization methods:

    -   Network graphs to see relationship between entities

    -   Interactive and/or animated graphs to see how relationships change through time

    -   Shiny app for users to interact and change parameters for analysis

3.  **Statistical Analysis:** To test and evaluate or hypothesis.

    -   Network centrality inidices (e.g., betweenness centrality)

    -   Community, to identify clusters of closely-knit nodes.

# **Prototype Sketches**

1.  Temporal patterns and corporate structures:

    Create detailed feature timelines that cover various time periods, such as monthly, quarterly, and yearly intervals. These timelines should be meticulously organized to allow analysts to track changes and trends over time effectively. In addition, integrate the corresponding company structures into these timelines to provide a comprehensive view. This integration helps analysts understand the context behind the data and correlating features with organizational changes. By binding the timelines with company structures, analysts can easily identify patterns, pinpoint causes of anomalies, and make informed predictions.

2.  Business Transactions:

    Convert transactions into embeddings using a Large Language Model (LLM) or another suitable encoding framework. This process involves transforming transactional data into a format that captures its semantic and contextual meaning, making it easier to analyze and interpret. Once the transactions are embedded, apply advanced anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns or deviations from expected behavior. These anomalies might indicate potential issues, fraudulent activities, or areas requiring further investigation.

    To understand the motivations behind these anomalies, leverage business heuristics and insights derived from the LLM interpretations. This combined approach ensures a thorough examination of anomalies, enabling more accurate and actionable insights into the underlying motivations and potential implications for the business.

3.  Network Influence:

    Given some specific companies, construct its business network by mapping out the relationships and interactions between various entities. Utilize data sources to construct these connections. Once the network is established, plot the network to visualize the impact of each entity within the network. This visualization helps identify central nodes and influential entities that significantly affect the company's operations and strategic decisions.

4.  SouthSeafood Express Corp Network:

    Based on the previously constructed business network, identify the relevant companies involved in the illegal fishing activity. Begin by analyzing the network to spot entities with suspicious patterns or connections that suggest involvement in illegal practices.

    Once the potentially involved companies are identified, delve into their transaction histories to uncover detailed evidence of their involvement. We can thus map out the methods and routes used for illegal fishing operations.
