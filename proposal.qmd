# Motivation

The motivation for this project stems from the urgent need to combat illegal fishing activities in the sensitive marine ecosystem of Oceanus. FishEye International aims to protect this environment by monitoring and analyzing business activities of commercial fishing operators. This project seeks to enhance the ability of FishEye’s analysts to visualize and understand complex business networks, and further aiding in the detection and prevention of illegal fishing.

# Objectives

This project aims to build an interactive visualization tool to enable FishEye’s analysts to effectively interpret the following changes related to illegal fishing on the business community:

1.  **Temporal patterns and corporate structures**: Highlight temporal patterns and corporate structures changes for analysts to track shareholders over time.

2.  **Business Transactions**: Identify typical and atypical business transactions and infer the motivations behind these activities.

3.  **Network Influence**: Examine how the influence of a company changes over time within the business network.

4.  **SohthSeafood Express Corp Network**: Visualize the network associated with SouthSeafood Express Corp and analyze how the network have changed due to the illegal fishing incident. Identify companies that benefited from SouthSeafood Express Corp’s legal troubles and potentially related transcations.

# Data

The project will examine the data from VAST Challenge 2024 [Mini-Challenge 3](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2024/MC3.html). The data contains the network for Oceanus’s commercial fishing business community. It contains 60,520 nodes, 75,817 edges, and 4,782 connected components.

Each node represents the entities in the fishing business community (including people and organizations). The edges represent the relationship between each pair of connected nodes.

# Methodology

The team will take the following approach:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and shaping data to what is needed for analysis. The following data will be prepared:

    -   Node and edge data for network data analysis. \@We will only use the 4,782 connected components in plotting the network data
    -   Non-network data for accompanying information, if needed (e.g. how many people involved, information about companies involved in fishing business)

2.  **Data Exploration & Visualization:** To identify patterns in the data and derive insights from them. We will use the following visualization methods:

    -   Network graphs to see relationship between entities

    -   Interactive and/or animated graphs to see how relationships change through time

    -   Shiny app for users to interact and change parameters for analysis

3.  **Statistical Analysis:** To test and evaluate or hypothesis.

    -   Network centrality inidices (e.g., betweenness centrality)

    -   Community, to identify clusters of closely-knit nodes.
