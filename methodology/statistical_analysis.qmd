# 1 Measures of centrality

We will be using 3 different measures of centrality in the shiny app: degree, pagerank, and betweenness

## 1.1 Degree centrality

We will use this in the **Corporate Structures** modules to identify the most active nodes in the system.

## 1.2 Pagerank centrality

We will use this measure of centrality to identify the **Power Holders**. The principle is that *the more incoming edges a node has, the more influential it is* and nodes to which they are connected share of that influence. ([Disney, 2020](https://cambridge-intelligence.com/eigencentrality-pagerank/))

## 1.3 Betweenness centrality

We will use this measure of centrality to identify the **Power Brokers**.

Power Brokers must be nodes with **both incoming and outgoing edges**, so that they can connect a more powerful node to a less powerful node. Hence, having a large number of edges connected to a node is not enough (which the degree centrality offers).

This is because if a node only has incoming or outgoing edges, it wonâ€™t be able to connect to other nodes to keep the flow going.
