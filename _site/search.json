FishEye International aims to protect this environment by monitoring and analyzing business activities of commercial fishing operators. This project seeks to enhance the ability of FishEye’s analysts to visualize and understand complex business networks, and further aiding in the detection and prevention of illegal fishing.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis project aims to build an interactive visualization tool to enable FishEye’s analysts to effectively interpret the following changes related to illegal fishing on the business community:\n\nTemporal patterns and corporate structures: Highlight temporal patterns and corporate structures changes for analysts to track shareholders over time.\nBusiness Transactions: Identify typical and atypical business transactions and infer the motivations behind these activities.\nNetwork Influence: Examine how the influence of a company changes over time within the business network.\nSohthSeafood Express Corp Network: Visualize the network associated with SouthSeafood Express Corp and analyze how the network have changed due to the illegal fishing incident. Identify companies that benefited from SouthSeafood Express Corp’s legal troubles and potentially related transcations.\n\n\n\nData\nJoy\n\n\nMethodology & Analytical Approach\nJoy\n\n\nPrototype Sketches\nBoth, depending on question part\n\n\nR Packages\n\ntidyverse\n\nAdd as needed\n\n\nProject Schedule\n\n\nShow code\nlibrary(vistime)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndata &lt;- read.csv(text=\"event,group,start,end,color\n                       ,Project Proposal,2024-05-12,2024-05-26,#a5d6a7\n                       ,Exploratory data analysis,2024-05-12,2024-05-26,#a5d6a7\n                       ,Exploratory data analysis,2024-05-26,2024-06-16,#DD4B39\n                       ,R Quarto/ Netlify,2024-05-12,2024-05-26,#a5d6a7\n                       ,R Quarto/ Netlify,2024-05-26,2024-06-30,#DD4B39\n                       ,R Shiny App,2024-05-26,2024-06-30,#DD4B39\n                       ,Poster,2024-06-16,2024-06-30,#DD4B39\n                       ,User Guide,2024-06-20,2024-06-30,#DD4B39\"\n                 )\n                \nproposal_deadline &lt;- as.Date(\"2024-05-26\") \n\np &lt;- gg_vistime(data, title = \"Project Timeline\") \np +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.POSIXct(\"2024-05-26\")), color = \"red\", size = 1)"

The data contains the network for Oceanus’s commercial fishing business community. It contains 60,520 nodes, 75,817 edges, and 4,782 connected components.\nEach node represents the entities in the fishing business community (including people and organizations). The edges represent the relationship between each pair of connected nodes.\n\n\nMethodology\nThe team will take the following approach:\n\nData Preparation\n\nClean and shape according to what ggraph needs to plot network data (nodes and edges)\nPrepare tibble data for accompanying information, if needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we are only interested in connections between different entities in the network data,\n\n\n\nData Exploration & Visualization\nStatistical Analysis\n\n\n\nPrototype Sketches\nBoth, depending on question part\n\n\nR Packages\n\ntidyverse\nggraph\n\nAdd as needed\n\n\nProject Schedule\nFengji"
