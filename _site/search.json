This distinction underscores a prevalent pattern where investors often gravitate towards sectors they possess familiarity with, leveraging their knowledge and insights for informed decision-making in their investment strategies.\nConversely, investing completely unrelated industries may be perceived as unconventional or even suspicious, as it deviates from the norm of investing in areas aligned with one’s expertise or established market understanding. This divergence from expected investment patterns prompts scrutiny into the rationale behind such decisions, and the potential risks associated with investing outside one’s domain of familiarity.\n\n\n\n\nWhile most companies attract fewer than 10 new investors per year, Downs Group attracted 120 shareholders in 2034. This raises suspicion, as investors typically exercise caution when investing in new companies. Such a significant surge in shareholder interest prompt questions about what factors might have contributed to this rapid increase in investor confidence towards Downs Group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe companies chosen by the top investors exhibit striking similarities. Upon examining image 3, it becomes evident that these investors not only target the same companies but also exert considerable influence due to the minimal presence of external shareholders or owners. This scenario suggests that a small, influential group of investors holds significant control over these companies.\nWhile these companies are not directly interconnected, they are intricately tied through the shared ownership and influential decisions made by this select group of shareholders. This concentration of ownership raises important considerations about the dynamics of corporate governance and market competition. As these investors continue to consolidate their positions, their collective influence could shape industry trends and strategic outcomes across the market landscape.\n\n\n\n\nIn this scenario, Isla is the beneficial owner of all the interconnected companies. It clearly indicates that she holds a significant and influential investment stake across these enterprises. By maintaining such extensive ownership, Isla likely exerts substantial control over the strategic and operational decisions of these companies, steering their direction and shaping their market behavior.

This includes people related to the family by marriage like Fintan Park, who is married to Lena Conti-Park.\nIt is highly likely that these people cooperate to maintain their control over all the fishing businesses in the network, which can pose a great challenge for FishEye in cracking down on illegal fishing.\n\n\n\nThe biggest companies in direct control of the Conti Clan serve as the power brokers in the network. This is because the clan uses these companies to exert control the other companies control.\nWithout visualizing the network, it may be difficult to follow the paper trail and identify the people behind the illegal fishing activities especially if it is hidden behind a series of companies."

These series of actions couldn’t have been executed quickly, in a span of less than 2 months, without any help. Being part of a power business network like the Conti Clan have played a part in this execution.\n\n\n2.3.1 Acquiring control of The News Buoy\n\nBefore the series of transactionsAfter the series of transactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, James Bell founded The News Buoy, a news company. 20 years later, Sam Conti becomes a shareholder of the company. He is a member of the aforementioned Conti Clan.\nThis is a very suspicious transaction as NGOs and news companies in Oceanus operate independently and without any connection to any other business. However, Sam Conti becoming a shareholder of The News Buoy will highly likely introduce bias in favor of the Conti Clan in the articles that the news company publish.\nThis could be an effort for the Conti Clan to control the narrative especially as one of their companies was caught illegal fishing.\nIt would be interesting to find out if Mini-Challenge 1 would lead to the same conclusion."

We think that this is the challenge we can accomplish with our own knowledge and those taught in class.\n\n\n\n\nWe looked at the seniors’ work so that we can base on our Project Proposal on from those.\n\nWe divided the work for the proposal as follows:\n\nFengji: Motivation, Objectives, Problem Statement, Project Schedule\nKristine: Data, Methodology, Github and Netlify setup\nShared: Project Sketches, R Package list\n\nFurthermore, for Take-home Ex3, we decided on the following:\n\nFengji: Questions 1 & 2\nKristine: Questions 3 & 4\n\n\nIf we have enough time, we will do 1 more question so that we can compare notes on the overlapping question.\n\n\n\n\nDate: 22/05/2024\nTime: 4:30 - 5:00 PM\nIn Attendance: Kristine Joy Paas, Tan Fengji\n\n\n\nProposal Check-in\nAction Items\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was only a few days before the proposal is due so we checked on each other’s progress.\n\nWe both have our parts ready by EoD.\n\nKristine updated that she won’t be available on Sunday (when the proposal is due).\nWe decided to drop the Problem Statement part as it is redundant with the Objectives.\nWe also decided for Prototype Sketches to be optional as we are not familiar how it will look in the Shiny app. Alternative is to just provide sketches based on normal visualizations.\nOur main blocker in creating the proposal is the lack of details that we cannot uncover unless we start doing the project.\n\n\n\n\n\nPush our work on the Project Proposal to Github so that we can check each other’s work.\nFengji to take care of submission on Sunday as Kristine will be out.\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: 22/06/2024\nTime: 9:00 - 9:30 PM\nIn Attendance: Kristine Joy Paas, Tan Fengji\n\n\n\nProject Check-in\nTask Prioritization\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have only been communicating by Teams in the last month as we focused on Take-Home Exam 3.\nAfter that, we independently studied how to convert our Take Home Exam 3 outputs to Shiny App.\n\nWe had more pressing deadlines in other modules so we agreed to prioritize those first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe items we still need to do for the project are:\n\nProject Site\n\nAdd prototype sketches\nAdd details on methodology\nPolish content\n\nPoster\nShiny App\n\nCombine our work\n\n\nWe decided to prioritize combining our Shiny Apps as we need the screenshots for the poster.\n\nSame with the Project Site, we will use Joy’s Github to collaborate on the Shiny App\nSubmitting the poster on Wednesday, June 26 is the highest priority\nMeet again on June 25 evening to finalize the poster."

    "text": "Motivation\nThe motivation for this project stems from the urgent need to combat illegal fishing activities in the sensitive marine ecosystem of Oceanus. FishEye International aims to protect this environment by monitoring and analyzing business activities of commercial fishing operators. This project seeks to enhance the ability of FishEye’s analysts to visualize and understand complex business networks, and further aiding in the detection and prevention of illegal fishing.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis project aims to build an interactive visualization tool to enable FishEye’s analysts to effectively interpret the following changes related to illegal fishing on the business community:\n\nTemporal patterns and corporate structures: Highlight temporal patterns and corporate structures changes for analysts to track shareholders over time.\nBusiness Transactions: Identify typical and atypical business transactions and infer the motivations behind these activities.\nNetwork Influence: Examine how the influence of a company changes over time within the business network.\nSouthSeafood Express Corp Network: Visualize the network associated with SouthSeafood Express Corp and analyze how the network have changed due to the illegal fishing incident. Identify companies that benefited from SouthSeafood Express Corp’s legal troubles and potentially related transactions.\n\n\n\nData\nThe project will examine the data from VAST Challenge 2024 Mini-Challenge 3. The data contains the network for Oceanus’s commercial fishing business community. It contains 60,520 nodes, 75,817 edges, and 4,782 connected components.\nEach node represents the entities in the fishing business community (including people and organizations). The edges represent the relationship or transactions between each pair of connected nodes.\n\n\nMethodology\n\nDiagramExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart\n  mc3_json[/in: mc3.json/]\n  sn_rds[/out: supernetwork.rds/]\n  \n  read[Read Input]\n  clean[Clean Data]\n  \n  extract_subnetwork[[Extract subnetwork]]\n  filter_date[[Filter by date]]\n  transform_power[[Transform power graph]]\n  \n  degree[Calculate degree centrality]\n  pagerank[Calculate pagerank centrality]\n  betweenness[Calculate betweenness centrality]\n  \n  plot_corp[Plot corporate structures]\n  plot_network[Plot network graphs]\n  plot_influence[Plot influence]\n  shiny[Shiny App]\n  \n  combine_data[/Combine based on requirement\\]\n  combine_plots[/Combine plots\\]\n  \n  clean -- save --&gt; sn_rds\n  mc3_json --&gt; read\n  \n  subgraph Data Preparation\n    read --&gt; clean\n    clean -.-&gt; extract_subnetwork\n    clean -.-&gt; filter_date\n    extract_subnetwork --&gt; combine_data\n    filter_date --&gt; combine\n    combine_data -.-&gt; transform_power\n    clean -.-&gt; transform_power\n  end\n  \n  subgraph Statistical Analysis\n    clean -.-&gt; degree\n    combine_data -.-&gt; degree\n    transform_power --&gt; pagerank\n    transform_power --&gt; betweenness\n  end\n  \n    \n  subgraph Data Exploration & Visualization\n    degree --&gt; plot_corp\n    pagerank --&gt; plot_influence\n    betweenness --&gt; plot_influence\n    transform_power --&gt; plot_network\n    combine_data --&gt; plot_network\n    plot_corp --&gt; combine_plots\n    plot_network --&gt; combine_plots\n    plot_influence --&gt; combine_plots\n    combine_plots --&gt; shiny_app\n  end\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Preparation: Cleaning and shaping data to what is needed for analysis.\n\nNetwork and temporal data to enable getting the network state at any given time.\nNon-network data for accompanying information, if needed (e.g. products and services)\nWriting helper functions to generate the following subgraphs for closer analysis\n\nGetting subgraph based on proximity to a given node\nGetting the network state, i.e. nodes and edges present at any given time.\nTransforming relationshion graph to power graph for use in calculating influence\n\n\nStatistical Analysis: To apply statistical methods to help in analysis\n\nCalculate degree centrality to identify most active nodes\nCalculate measures of centrality to identify influential nodes\n\npagerank centrality for the nodes that hold the most power over resources in the network (the power holders).\nbetweenness centrality for the nodes the broker the power of a powerful node over the less powerful ones.\n\n\nData Exploration & Visualization: To identify patterns in the network and derive inferences from them.\n\nInteractive network graphs to see relationship between entities\nShiny app for users to interact and change parameters for analysis\n\nA time slider will be provided to easily see how the network changes through time\n\nBy looking at various network structures, identify the following:\n\nKinds of business transactions\nInfluential nodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototype Sketches\n\nTemporal patterns and corporate structures:\nCreate detailed feature timelines that cover various time periods, such as monthly, quarterly, and yearly intervals. These timelines should be meticulously organized to allow analysts to track changes and trends over time effectively. In addition, integrate the corresponding company structures into these timelines to provide a comprehensive view. This integration helps analysts understand the context behind the data and correlating features with organizational changes. By binding the timelines with company structures, analysts can easily identify patterns, pinpoint causes of anomalies, and make informed predictions.\nBusiness Transactions:\nConvert transactions into embeddings using a Large Language Model (LLM) or another suitable encoding framework. This process involves transforming transactional data into a format that captures its semantic and contextual meaning, making it easier to analyze and interpret. Once the transactions are embedded, apply advanced anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns or deviations from expected behavior. These anomalies might indicate potential issues, fraudulent activities, or areas requiring further investigation.\nTo understand the motivations behind these anomalies, leverage business heuristics and insights derived from the LLM interpretations. This combined approach ensures a thorough examination of anomalies, enabling more accurate and actionable insights into the underlying motivations and potential implications for the business.\nNetwork Influence:\nGiven some specific companies, construct its business network by mapping out the relationships and interactions between various entities. Utilize data sources to construct these connections. Once the network is established, plot the network to visualize the impact of each entity within the network. This visualization helps identify central nodes and influential entities that significantly affect the company’s operations and strategic decisions.\nSouthSeafood Express Corp Network:\nBased on the previously constructed business network, identify the relevant companies involved in the illegal fishing activity. Begin by analyzing the network to spot entities with suspicious patterns or connections that suggest involvement in illegal practices.\nOnce the potentially involved companies are identified, delve into their transaction histories to uncover detailed evidence of their involvement. We can thus map out the methods and routes used for illegal fishing operations.\n\n\n\nR Packages\n\ntidyverse: A collection of R packages used in data science, which includes ggplot2, tibble, readr\nvistime: For visualizing timelines\nggraph: Extension of ggplot2 for plotting relational data\nvisNetwork: For plotting interactive network visualizations, compatible with Shiny\njsonlite: For parsing JSON data\n\n\n\nProject Schedule\n\n\nShow code\npacman::p_load(vistime, ggplot2)\ndata &lt;- read.csv(text=\"event,group,start,end,color\n                       ,Project Proposal,2024-05-12,2024-05-26,#a5d6a7\n                       ,Exploratory data analysis,2024-05-12,2024-05-26,#a5d6a7\n                       ,Exploratory data analysis,2024-05-26,2024-06-16,#DD4B39\n                       ,R Quarto/ Netlify,2024-05-12,2024-05-26,#a5d6a7\n                       ,R Quarto/ Netlify,2024-05-26,2024-06-30,#DD4B39\n                       ,R Shiny App,2024-05-26,2024-06-30,#DD4B39\n                       ,Poster,2024-06-16,2024-06-30,#DD4B39\n                       ,User Guide,2024-06-20,2024-06-30,#DD4B39\"\n                 )\n                \nproposal_deadline &lt;- as.Date(\"2024-05-26\") \n\np &lt;- gg_vistime(data, title = \"Project Timeline\") \np +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.POSIXct(\"2024-05-26\")), color = \"red\", size = 1)"
